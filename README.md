# Probabilistic AI for Autonomous Decision Making in Uncertainty Rich Environments


### Project Overview:
This project focuses on developing Probabilistic AI systems that enable autonomous decision-making in environments filled with uncertainty. The core idea is to create an AI framework that incorporates uncertainty-aware model building and simulation-based inference for verifiable and interpretable decision-making. This system could be applied in various real-world scenarios like autonomous driving, financial modeling, or healthcare decision systems, where actions must be made under uncertain conditions.

### Goal:
The project aims to develop a data-efficient and privacy-preserving probabilistic AI system that enhances autonomous decision-making capabilities. The system will focus on efficiently handling uncertain and incomplete data while providing interpretable results that users and stakeholders can trust.

### Key Features:

1. Probabilistic Modeling: The AI system will use probabilistic models to estimate uncertainties in predictions and decisions.
2. Simulation-Based Inference: Simulation-based methods (like Markov Chain Monte Carlo) will be used to model complex systems and enable efficient reasoning.
3. Data-Efficient Learning: The AI will learn efficiently from small or incomplete datasets while providing robust predictions.
4. Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms: Secure AI techniques such as differential privacy will be implemented to protect user data.
5. Interpretable Decisions: The AI will offer interpretable explanations for its decision-making processes, making it useful in safety-critical applications.
6. Technical Implementation:

### The project will involve:

      Probabilistic Programming for uncertainty modeling.
      Bayesian Inference for decision-making under uncertainty.
      Reinforcement Learning to enhance the AI's ability to make decisions autonomously.
      Privacy-Preserving AI to secure user data.
      Interpretability techniques to explain decisions and actions taken by the AI.


### Step-by-Step Implementation:
1. Probabilistic Modeling with Pyro (or PyMC3)
Probabilistic programming allows us to build probabilistic models that can quantify uncertainty and provide more reliable decisions. In this case, we use Pyro (or PyMC3) for probabilistic model building.

2. Simulation-Based Inference for Complex Reasoning
When dealing with complex systems (e.g., autonomous systems), simulation-based inference techniques such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can help model and reason through complex data.

3. Autonomous Decision-Making with Reinforcement Learning
Using Reinforcement Learning (RL), the AI can autonomously make decisions in an uncertain environment and learn from its experiences. This is useful in autonomous systems like self-driving cars or robotic systems.

4. Privacy-Preserving AI using Differential Privacy
To ensure privacy, we integrate Differential Privacy methods into our AI models, especially when working with sensitive user data.

5. Interpretable AI for Decision Transparency
We will integrate interpretable models to provide explanations for the AI's decision-making process, helping users understand why certain decisions are made.

6. Interactive Frontend for AI-Assisted Decision-Making
The final component is an interactive frontend (built using React or Vue.js) where users can input data, visualize results, and get interpretability reports.
